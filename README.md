# Birche Games Monolith

I have decided to move to a monolith style architecture, because my previous attempt at developing with micro services was becoming bogged down when it came to deployment and configurations. I was spending more time writing my own personal boilerplate and configuring services than actually creating, so I abandoned the project.

This isn't meant to be an insult to micro services or praise to monoliths. I'm not really interested in that argument at the moment. I have just decided that in my current situation as a solo develope, my current skillset, and my current plan for the project; I've decided to take this route for this application.
